# Fast-Valorant-Triggerbot
Fastest Available Undetected Triggerbot for Valorant

# About it
Reaction time is equivalent to your refresh rate, during testing I measured around 2-10ms reaction time,
which is extremely fast for a python triggerbot. This Triggerbot can be used with any hotkey you'd like,
just go into config.json and replace trigger_hotkey with any virtual key code, you can find them here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes


# How to setup
- If you you're a coder, you can use the source, if not please proceed to use the exe.
- Start Exe, Start Valorant, go to ingame settings and use purple outline.
- While being in ingame settings go to keybinds and add K as a second shoot keybind.
- By default it shift is the hotkey, if you have always enabled turn on, use f10 instead.
- Should work
